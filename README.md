   - Define your Prisma schema inside this folder.
   - Install the required dependencies by following the Prisma documentation.

2. **Next.js API Routes:**
   - In the `pages` folder at the root level, navigate to `api` > `auth` > `[...nextauth].ts`.
   - Configure Google Providers and any other necessary authentication settings.

3. **Prisma Client Instantiation:**
   - Create a `prisma` folder in `libs` with a `prismadb.ts` file.
   - Follow best practices for instantiating the Prisma Client.

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Get the URL for your database and ensure it's properly configured.
   - Run `npx prisma db push` to synchronize your schema with the database. Ensure environment variables are loaded from `.env`.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




## STRIPE ERROR I FACED

1. **Handling Stripe Payments:**
   - If you're experiencing issues with payment statuses not updating, try running `npm run build` and `npm run start` before performing the checkout.
   - Verify that only one entry exists in the database post-checkout.
   - Log into Stripe via the command prompt and complete the payment process to ensure correct updates.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




## FIREBASE SETUP

. **Navigation Bar & Firebase:**
   - Set up your navigation bar.
   - Configure Firebase and ensure to publish the necessary rules.

3. **Updating Prisma Schema:**
   - Update the Prisma schema to include product models.

4. **API for Products:**
   - Write an API endpoint for adding products to the database immediately after updating the Prisma schema.

5. **Add Product Form:**
   - Develop the form for adding new products to your system.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






##  Workflow Summary for Adding Products
----------------------------------------

### 1. Set Up the Form

- **Start with `AddProductsForm`:**  
  This is your main stage. It's got all the fields for adding a product—name, price, brand, description, stock status, and images.

### 2. Image Handling

- **`SelectImage` Component:**  
  It grabs the images. But it's like, 'Cool, now what?'

- **`SelectColour` Component:**  
  This is the parent. It says, 'Yo, pass me that image with `handleFileChange` and I'll handle it.'

- **Passing the File Up:**  
  `SelectImage` sends the file to `SelectColour`.

- **`AddProductsForm` Takes Over:**  
  This is the grandparent. It says, 'I'll take that image and keep track of everything with `addImageToState`.'

### 3. Image Uploads

- **Upload Process:**
  - **Create File Name:** Generate a name for the file with a timestamp.
  - **Upload to Firebase Storage:** Use Firebase to handle the upload.
  - **Get Download URL:** Fetch the URL once uploaded.
  - **Update State:** Push the image data to `uploadedImages`.

### 4. Form Submission

- **Form Submission (`onSubmit`):**  
  - **Check Validity:** Make sure there's a category and images.
  - **Upload Images:** Call `handleImageUploads` to manage image uploads.
  - **Send Data:** Post the data to `/api/product` with Axios.

### 5. API and Prisma Updates

- **Update Prisma Schema:**  
  Ensure your Prisma schema reflects the product and image details.

- **API Endpoint:**  
  Create an API endpoint at `/api/product` to handle product creation in the database.

### 6. Rendering and Conditional Access

- **Render `AddProductsForm`:**  
  - **Component Rendering:** Displays the form for adding products.

- **Access Check (`AddProducts`):**  
  - **Check User Role:** Ensure only admins can access this page.

### 7. Firebase Configuration

- **Initialize Firebase:**
  - **Config:** Use the provided Firebase config to initialize your app.

That's how you handle adding products from top to bottom. It’s all about passing data up the chain and managing uploads like a pro.







## PARENT CHILD RELATION WITH THA STATS AND MOST REVISED CONCEPT OF MINE (ADD PRODUCTS OF THE ADMIN )

So, we're starting from the bottom, right? With that `SelectImage` component. It's sitting there like, 'Cool, I can grab images now. But uh... now what?'

That's when the parent component, `SelectColour`, swoops in like, 'Yo, I gotchu. When you get that image, hit me up with this `handleFileChange` function.'

`SelectImage` is all, 'Sweet, I'll just pass that file up to you then.'

Now `SelectColour` has the file and it's like, 'Awesome, I've got this image. But... now what? I'm not supposed to be the one actually keeping it.'

That's when the grandparent, `AddProductsForm`, comes in clutch. It's like, 'Don't sweat it, kid. I'm the big boss here. You just call this `addImageToState` function and I'll take care of it.'

`SelectColour` is relieved, like, 'Oh thank god, I was not ready for that responsibility.'

So `SelectColour` takes that image, slaps it together with the color info, and sends it up to `AddProductsForm`.

`AddProductsForm` is chillin' at the top like, 'Yep, just send all that stuff my way. I'll keep track of everything.'

It's like a game of hot potato, but with images. Nobody wants to hold onto it for long, they just pass it up the chain until it reaches the top dog who's like, 'I got this.'

Is this making more sense now? Or are you still feeling a bit lost in the sauce with any part of it?





----------------------------------------------------------------------------





##  Workflow Summary for Managing Products
------------------------------------------

**First Things First - UI Setup:**  
Kick it off by building the `ManageProductsClient` component. This is where all the magic happens with the DataGrid. This grid is your front-end playground where you’ll see all your products in rows—think of it like your control panel.

**Fetching the Goods - Product Data:**  
Pull in the products with the `getProducts` function. This bad boy grabs everything from the database and filters it based on what you’re looking for (category, search term, etc.). It even brings in product reviews if they exist.

**Who’s the Boss? - User Access:**  
Check who’s in charge with `getCurrentUser`. If the user ain’t an admin, they don’t get to play with the product management tools. Simple as that—no admin, no access.

**Handle Your Business - Action Buttons:**  
Inside the grid, you’ve got action buttons:  
- **Toggle Stock:** Flip a product’s stock status on or off with `handleToggleStock`.  
- **Delete Product:** Remove a product and its Firebase images with `productDelete`.  
- **View Product:** Jump to the product’s detail page by clicking the eye icon.

**Clean Up - Product Deletion:**  
When it’s time to delete a product, start by trashing its images from Firebase. Use `deleteObject` to handle that. Then, nuke the product from the database with an API call.

**If You’re Running Orders - Order Management:**  
If orders are part of the game, use `getOrders` to fetch them. You’ll get all the orders, including which user placed each one.

**Keep it Fresh - Navigation and Refresh:**  
Use `useRouter` to navigate and refresh after actions. This keeps your data fresh and your UI in check.

**No Surprises - Error Handling:**  
Use `toast` to keep users in the loop. Success or fail, make sure they know what’s up.

That's how you handle product management, no fluff, straight to the point.






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






###  Workflow Summary for Managing Orders
-----------------------------------------

**UI Gameplan - Orders Overview:**  
Start with the `ManageOrdersClient` component. This is your command center, showing all the orders in a DataGrid. Each row is like a receipt on your dashboard—customer info, amount, statuses, all laid out.

**Pulling Orders - Fetch the Details:**  
Use the `getOrders` function to grab all the orders from the database, along with the details of the users who placed them. Orders are sorted by when they were created, so the freshest ones are at the top.

**Who Runs This? - Admin Check:**  
Get the current user with `getCurrentUser`. If they’re not an admin, show them the door with `NullData`. Only admins get to mess with the order management tools.

**Handling Orders - Action Time:**  
Inside the grid, you've got your action buttons:
- **Dispatch Order:** Use `handleDispatch` to update an order’s delivery status to "dispatched."
- **Deliver Order:** Use `handleDeliver` to mark the order as "delivered."
- **View Order:** Hit the eye icon to check out the order details on a separate page.

**Tracking Status - Payment & Delivery:**  
Status icons are your quick-glance helpers:
- **Pending Payment or Delivery:** Gray icons keep it chill, showing something’s still in the works.
- **Completed Payment:** A green check marks the payment as locked in.
- **Dispatched or Delivered:** Purple for dispatched, green for delivered—keeping it color-coded for clarity.

**Smooth Moves - Data Refresh:**  
After you update an order’s status, `useRouter` jumps in to refresh the page, making sure the grid always shows the latest.

**No Mess-Ups - Error Handling:**  
Keep the user updated with `toast` messages. Whether it's a success or a slip-up, let them know what went down.

That’s how you stay on top of order management, cutting through the noise, and keeping it all under control.






---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






###  Workflow Summary for Order Details (Table)
----------------------------------------------

**Getting Started - Orders Overview:**  
Start with the `Orders` component. This is where you check if a user is logged in and authorized. If they’re not, they get the boot with a `NullData` message.

**Fetching Orders - User-Specific Data:**  
Once you’ve got the current user with `getCurrentUser`, pull their specific orders using `getOrdersByUserId`. This function snags all orders tied to that user ID, sorted by the latest date.

**UI Setup - Orders Display:**  
Render the `OrdersClient` component if everything checks out. This is where the DataGrid comes into play, showing all the user’s orders with details like customer name, amount, payment status, and delivery status.

**Action Buttons - Order Insights:**  
Within each order row, there’s an action button to view order details:
- **View Order:** Click the eye icon to jump to a detailed view of the order.

**Status Icons - Quick Glance:**  
Payment and delivery statuses are marked with icons to keep it simple:
- **Pending Payment/Delivery:** Gray icons indicate something’s still in the pipeline.
- **Completed Payment:** Green check means the payment’s locked in.
- **Dispatched/Delivered:** Purple for dispatched, green for delivered—keeping things organized.

**Clean Layout - DataGrid Customization:**  
Your DataGrid setup includes pagination and row selection. The rows are populated with all the relevant order details, giving users a clear snapshot of their order history.

**Back-End Work - Fetching User Orders:**  
The `getOrdersByUserId` function digs into the database, finding all orders for a specific user, including user info. The results are ordered by creation date, so the most recent ones show up first.

That’s the rundown on managing and displaying order details—keeping it tight, functional, and user-focused.






----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------







### Workflow Summary for Order Details
--------------------------------------

**Starting Up - Order Page Basics:**  
Kick things off with the `Order` component. It checks if an order exists using `getOrderById`. If no order is found, you hit ‘em with a `NullData` message.

**Order Fetching - Grab That Data:**  
Use `getOrderById` to pull the order details based on the `orderId` from the `params`. This function gets the order info you need to display.

**UI Layout - Show It Off:**  
If the order's found, wrap it up in a `Container` and pass it to `OrderDetails` for the detailed view. This is where you show all the juicy details about the order.

**Order Item Breakdown - Details Galore:**  
In `OrderDetails`, you lay out the order's basic info:
- **Order ID:** Just show it off.
- **Total Amount:** Price tag, formatted.
- **Payment Status:** Icons and text to show if it's pending or complete.
- **Delivery Status:** Icons to show pending, dispatched, or delivered.

**Product List - What’s in the Order?:**  
List out the products in the order with `OrderItem`:
- **Product Image:** Show the item’s pic.
- **Product Name:** Display the name and color.
- **Price, Quantity, Total:** Format and show them cleanly.


**Date & Time - When’s It Happenin’?:**  
Show how long ago the order was made using `moment` to format it into a readable time frame.

That’s the scoop on setting up and showing off order details—smooth, stylish, and straight to the point.







-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






# WORKFLOW FOR THE FITER AND SEARCH FEATURE
-------------------------------------------

## Product Stash:
You got your products in a database. That's your inventory, feel me?  
**Code:** Your Prisma setup.

## Home Page Hustle:
This is your storefront. You're showing off your goods here.  
**Code:** `Home` component in your Next.js app.

## Category Game:
Those buttons at the top? That's how customers pick what they wanna see. Click 'Clothes', and bam! Only clothes show up.  
**Code:** `CategoryItem` component.

## Search Hustle:
Customer types "red shoes", the URL changes. It's like whispering to your store what they want.  
**Code:** `useSearchParams` from Next.js and query string handling.

## URL Magic:
That web address? It's your customer's wishlist. It tells your store what to show.  
**Code:** The URL params created by `queryString.stringifyUrl`.

## Filtering Finesse:
`getProducts` function? That's your stock boy. It reads the URL and pulls the right shit from the back.  
**Code:** `getProducts` function with URL params.

## Display Dance:
`ProductCard` is like your mannequin. It shows off each item nice and pretty.  
**Code:** `ProductCard` component.

---

## Now, the Flow:

1. **Customer rolls up to your site:**  
   **Code:** Entry point in the `Home` component.

2. **They click 'Clothes' or search "red shoes":**  
   **Code:** `CategoryItem` handles clicks, search bar changes URL params.

3. **URL changes like "/?category=Clothes" or "/?searchTerm=red+shoes":**  
   **Code:** `queryString` handles updating the URL.

4. **Your code peeps that URL:**  
   **Code:** `useSearchParams` to read URL parameters.

5. **It tells `getProducts` "Yo, get me clothes" or "Find red shoes":**  
   **Code:** The `getProducts` function fetches based on those URL params.

6. **`getProducts` digs through your stash and pulls what matches:**  
   **Code:** `getProducts` function queries the database.

7. **Your page reloads, showing only what the customer asked for:**  
   **Code:** The `Home` component re-renders with the new products.

---

It's all about reading what the customer wants (from the URL) and showing them exactly that shit. No more, no less.

## Build It Like This:

1. **Sort out your product database first:**  
   **Code:** Set up Prisma with your product schema.

2. **Make a basic page that shows all products:**  
   **Code:** The initial `Home` component that renders `ProductCard`s.

3. **Add them category buttons and search bar:**  
   **Code:** Implement `CategoryItem` components and search handling.

4. **Make 'em change the URL when clicked or typed in:**  
   **Code:** Use `queryString` and `useSearchParams` for URL manipulation.

5. **Create that `getProducts` function to read the URL and pull the right stuff:**  
   **Code:** Write the `getProducts` function to handle fetching logic.

6. **Hook it all together so the page updates when the URL changes:**  
   **Code:** The `useEffect` or similar hooks in your `Home` component.





------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# WORKFLOW FOR THE REVIEW FEATURE



# The API Game (POST function)

This is your bouncer. It's checking IDs, making sure nobody's sneaking in reviews they ain't supposed to.

1. **Who the fuck are you?**  
   `getCurrentUser`

2. **This product even real?**  
   `getProductFromDB`

3. **You already ran your mouth about this?**  
   `userAlreadyReviewed`

4. **You even bought this shit and got it delivered?**  
   `userBoughtAndGotProduct`

If all that checks out, boom, your review's in. If not, it's kicking you to the curb with an error.

# The Front-End Hustle (AddRating component)

This is your street corner where people drop their reviews. But it ain't open to everyone.

- It's checking if you're logged in and if the product's legit.
- Then it's like "You bought this and got it? You ain't already reviewed it?" If not, you don't even see the form.
- When you do review, it's sending that shit to the API we talked about.

# The Review Showcase (ListRating component)

This is your wall of fame (or shame) for product reviews.

- First up, it's checking if there are even any reviews. No reviews? It ain't showing shit.
- If there are reviews, it's laying them out nice and pretty.

# The Product Page (Product component)

This is like the main street where it all comes together.

- It's grabbing the product details and the user info.
- If the product don't exist, it's showing a "This shit ain't here" message.
- It's putting the product details up top, then the add rating form (if you're allowed), then all the reviews.

---

## Strategy

### Edge Case Thinking

You gotta always be thinking "What could go wrong?" Like:

- What if there's no user?
- What if the product don't exist?
- What if they're trying to review something they didn't buy?

Always check for this shit first before you do anything else.

### Server Actions vs API

- **Use Server Actions** for quick, internal shit. Like fetching product details or user info.
- **Use APIs** for stuff that needs more security checks or could be hit from outside your app. Like submitting a review.

### Component Logic

- Always check if you got the data you need before rendering. That's why you see shit like `if(!product) return null`.
- Think about what conditions need to be met for something to show. Like, should this user even see the review form?

### Data Flow

- Your data should flow from the top down. That's why you're fetching product and user at the page level and passing it down.

### Separation of Concerns

- Keep your API logic separate from your display logic.
- Your API should handle all the heavy security checks.
- Your components should focus on displaying shit and maybe some light checks.

---

## To Get Good at This:

1. Always think about what could go wrong.
2. Check for the bad shit first, then do the good shit.
3. Keep your logic separated: API does the hard checks, components do the display.

   - **Always check if you got the data you need before rendering.**  
     For example, `if(!product) return null` is a way to make sure you aren't trying to display something that ain't there. This prevents unnecessary errors and keeps your app running smoothly.

   - **Think about what conditions need to be met for something to show.**  
     Like, should this user even see the review form? Maybe they haven't bought the product yet or already left a review. Only show components when it makes sense to do so.

4. Pass your data down from the top, don't fetch the same shit in multiple places.
5. Use Server Actions for quick, internal data fetches.
6. Use APIs for anything that needs serious security or could be accessed from outside.


---

### Final Words

Coding ain't just about making shit work. It's about making shit work right, making it secure, and making it smooth. You gotta think like a paranoid bouncer who's also a fucking artist. Check everything, but make it look good too. That's how you run these code streets, ya feel me?






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# WORKFLOW FOR THE STATUS/SUMMARY FEATURE



- **Old Data Cloning**: 
  - We're using `setSummaryData` to update the data, but we ain't just slappin' new data in there. Nah, we're takin' the old data (that's what `'prev'` is), makin' a copy with that `'...prev'` spread operator - that's like makin' a clone, you feel me?

## Data Processing

- **Total Sale Calculation**:
  - We go through all them orders with `reduce` - it's like countin' up all your cash after a big score. We're only countin' the 'complete' orders though, 'cause we ain't about to count money we ain't got yet.

- **Filter Paid and Unpaid Orders**:
  - Then we got these `filter` functions. We're sortin' out the paid and unpaid orders. It's like separatin' the real G's from the ones still owin' us.

## Updating Data

- **Update TempData**:
  - After all that, we're updatin' our `tempData`. We're puttin' in the total sales, how many orders we got, how many are paid, how many ain't, how many products we're pushin', and how many users we got in our crew.



## Dependency Array

- **Smart Running**:
  - And check this - we're only runnin' this when orders, products, or users change. That's that dependency array at the end of `useEffect`. Smart shit, right? We ain't doin' all this math for no reason.




  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# WORKFLOW FOR THE CHART FEATURE




# Ultimate Goal

Get an array of objects, each with `day`, `date`, and `totalAmount`.

## Steps to Achieve This

### a) Query the DB

1. Use a date range (last 7 days).
2. Group orders by created date.
3. Sum up the amounts for each day.

### b) Create a Structure for All 7 Days, Even If No Sales

1. Use an object (`aggregatedData`).
2. Keys are days of the week.
3. Values are objects with `day`, `date`, and `totalAmount` (initially 0).

### c) Update the `aggregatedData` with Actual Sales

1. Loop through the DB results.
2. Add the summed amount to the corresponding day in `aggregatedData`.

### d) Convert the `aggregatedData` Object to an Array and Sort It

1. Convert the `aggregatedData` object to an array.
2. Sort the array by date.

                              -----------------------------------
                       🚨 🚨 |    SERVER ACTIONS VS APIS       |  🚨 🚨 
                              -----------------------------------


## **APIs vs Server Actions:**
APIs are like the old-school corner store. Everyone knows where it is, anyone can roll up and get what they need.  
**Code:** `API routes` in Next.js, using `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

Server Actions are like your personal stash in your crib. Quick access, but only for you and your crew.  
**Code:** `Server Actions` in Next.js, handling logic directly on the server side, avoiding the need for external calls.

---

## **Prisma Operations:**
Yeah, `prisma.product.find`, `prisma.update`, `prisma.product.create` - all that shit? That's your backend muscle.  
**Code:** `Prisma` operations for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on your database.

You can flex these in both APIs and Server Actions. It's just about where you're doing it.  
**Code:** Using Prisma within `API routes` or `Server Actions` to interact with your database.

---

## **Why Still Use APIs:**

- **Public Access**: If you want randoms to hit up your data, APIs are your bouncer. They control who gets in.  
  **Code:** `API routes` with authentication and authorization to manage access.

- **Separation**: If your frontend and backend are in different hoods, APIs are your messenger.  
  **Code:** `API routes` to communicate between different services or frontend and backend when they’re separated.

- **Scalability**: APIs help when your app blows up and you need to split shit up.  
  **Code:** `API routes` for microservices architecture, scaling independently as your app grows.

---

## **Server Actions Advantage:**

- **Speed**: It's like having a secret tunnel in your house. Faster than going out the front door (API).  
  **Code:** `Server Actions` for faster server-side processing without extra HTTP requests.

- **Simplicity**: Less code to write. No need for all that fetch and state management bullshit.  
  **Code:** `Server Actions` directly manipulate data without needing `fetch` or other client-side code.

- **Security**: Your data stays in the house. No need to expose it to the streets.  
  **Code:** `Server Actions` keep sensitive operations within the server, reducing exposure.

---

## **The Real Talk:**

You're right. For a lot of internal shit, Server Actions can replace those `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` APIs.  
**Code:** Using `Server Actions` for internal CRUD operations to streamline the process.

But it ain't about completely ghosting APIs. It's about using the right tool for the job.  
**Code:** Balance between `API routes` and `Server Actions` depending on the use case.

---

## **When to Keep APIs:**

- **Third-party integrations**: Some external services only speak API.  
  **Code:** `API routes` for integrating with external services like payment gateways or third-party APIs.

- **Public data**: If you want others to build on your platform, APIs are the way.  
  **Code:** `Public API routes` to expose data for external developers or public use.

- **Mobile apps**: If you got a separate mobile app, it might need APIs to talk to your backend.  
  **Code:** `API routes` for mobile app communication with your backend.

---

## **Bottom Line:**

Server Actions are like your personal chef in your kitchen. APIs are like a restaurant. Both cook food, but for different scenarios.  
**Code:** Use `Server Actions` for internal, quick, and secure operations, and `API routes` when you need to expose data or interact with external systems.

Remember, it's all about that flexibility. Build smart, keep your options open, and use what makes your life easier and your app faster. That's the street-smart way to code, ya feel me?

### Street-Style Quick Revision

**Params (URL shit):**

- **Use when:** Your data changes based on the page or what the user's looking at
- **Examples:** Product details, order info, user profiles
- **How it looks:** `function({ params }) { ... }`
- **Why:** 'Cause you're pulling specific shit based on what's in the URL

**Direct Calls (Straight-up function calls):**

- **Use when:** You need the same info everywhere, regardless of the page
- **Examples:** Current user, app settings, global state shit
- **How it looks:** `const data = getCurrentUser()`
- **Why:** It's always the same data, so why complicate it?

**Quick Check:**

- **Is the data different for each page/item?** → Params
- **Is it the same shit everywhere?** → Direct call

**Pro Tips:**

- **Params =** Dynamic, changes with the URL
- **Direct calls =** Static, same everywhere
- **Mixing both?** Yeah, that's normal. Just know why you're using each

**When in Doubt:**

Ask yourself: "Does this data change if I'm on a different page?"

- **Yes** → Params
- **No** → Direct call

**Real-World E-Commerce Example:**

- **Scenario 1: Product Details Page**  
  You’re on a product details page, and the URL has a product ID (e.g., `/products/123`). You need to fetch details for this specific product.
  - **Does the data change if you’re on a different page?**  
    Yes: The product details change based on the product ID in the URL.
  - **So:** You use Params.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Fetch product details based on the product ID from the URL
    const product = await getProductById(params.productId);
    ```

- **Scenario 2: User Profile**  
  You’re on different pages of the app (home, orders, cart), but you need to show the currently logged-in user’s name or details.
  - **Does the data change if you’re on a different page?**  
    No: The logged-in user is the same across all pages.
  - **So:** You use Direct call.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Fetch the currently logged-in user’s details
    const user = await getCurrentUser();
    ```

**In Summary:**

- **Use Params** when you need data that changes based on the page or URL (e.g., fetching details for a specific product based on the product ID in the URL).
- **Use Direct Calls** when you need consistent data that doesn’t change based on the page (e.g., fetching details of the logged-in user, no matter what page they’re on).

                  🚨 🚨      | MASTERING ASYNC IN CLIENT COMPONENTS |  🚨 🚨 
                              ---------------------------------------


## The Street Smart Moves

1. **Keep Async in Check:**  
   In client components, keep your async stuff inside functions that get called when something happens (like submitting a form). Don’t try to do async stuff when the component's just rendering.

2. **Client vs. Server:**  
   Client-side and server-side play by different rules. On the client side, you're in the browser, so handle async stuff when it happens.

3. **Keep It Smooth:**  
   This keeps your app smooth while still getting shit done. That's how you run these code streets, ya feel me?
